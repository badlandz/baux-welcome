# Roxanne Cyberdeck Live – README (the real one)

This is not a normal distro.  
This is a loaded gun on a USB stick.

- You boot it → you are root  
- No login  
- No password  
- No sudo  
- No user  
- Caps Lock is dead (Escape lives there now)  
- Everything runs in RAM by default  
- You are already in god mode

## Why the fuck would anyone do this?

Because I lost everything in 1997 running as root and I never want to spend another hour of my life setting up a user, fixing permissions, or typing `sudo` again.

Because I have a drawer full of Pis, old laptops, and dead machines and I want to plug in a USB and be in full control in under 5 seconds.

Because the machine is disposable. When I’m done I wipe it or throw the SD card away. Nothing important lives here except the tool itself.

Because backups exist. The real data is on the NAS, the git server, the offline drives. This blade is just a scalpel.

## What you get

- baux + tmux + dwm-roxanne + transparent Alacritty  
- Red toxic rice  
- Mod4 = windows, Alt = tmux, hjkl = vim (layers forever)  
- Bottom bar shows only the date/time in red  
- Picom running, everything transparent  
- Full Debian repos (just `apt install whatever`)

## First boot screen tells you the truth

You’ll see one ncurses dialog:
